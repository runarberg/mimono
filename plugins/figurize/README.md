Figurize
========

For each image in an article generated by pelican, this plugin will...

1. Wrap it, and the subsequent paragraph, in a `<figure>` tag.
2. Change the tag of the subsequent paragraph to `<figcaption>`.

It is good for Chantal's page so she can write each blogpost as a list figures
with appropriate figcaptions.

How it works
------------

All text followed by an image in the same paragraph will be wraped inside
`<figcaption>`, each paragraph break will conclude the `<figure>`

    !(image)[src/to/img.jpg "some alt"] This will be turned into *figcaption*

will be compiled to...

    <figure>
        <img src="src/to/img.jpg" alt="some alt" />
        <figcaption>This will be turned into <em>figcaption</em></figcaption>
    </figure>

Usage
-----

To write a ‘figurized’ blog post, start each paragraph with an image
`!(image)[some/img.jpg "some alt text"]` followed by the caption you want.

To start the next figure, leave an empty line (paragraph break) and specify
your next picture.

### Example

    !(image)[some/img1.jpg] This is the caption of the first figure

    !(image)[some/img2.jpg] And this will be displayed under the second image
    It can have multiple line, but the next blank line will conclude the
    figure.
